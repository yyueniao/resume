              I was responsible for a variety of tasks including frontend and backend development,
              unit testing, and code maintenance. I utilized a wide range of technologies such as
              TypeScript, PHP Laravel, jQuery, React, NextJS, Java, bash, and Haskell to build web
              applications, and I used Git as a version control tool. Furthermore, I have extensive
              experience writing MySQL and PostgreSQL queries to manipulate and manage databases.

              One of my notable projects involved writing an algorithm in Haskell based on KSPwLO,
              which was designed to find the K shortest paths in a graph, taking into account both
              price and latency. I also have experience writing unit tests in both Java and Haskell
              to ensure the reliability of my code. In addition, I have been involved in refactoring
              a project written in React, TypeScript and NextJS to make the code more maintainable
              and readable.

              As an intern, I contributed to the development of a platform using ASP.NET Core while
              working in a team that practiced agile methodologies and followed a Test Driven
              Development (TDD) workflow. My responsibilities included writing end-to-end automation
              test code using Angular. The products I worked on included credit and information
              services, as well as decisioning and analytics tools.

              I developed web pages and a mobile app using JavaScript, gaining practical experience
              and the ability to learn new technologies. I also performed UI/UX design work. The
              product I worked on was a customizable ERP system with cloud capabilities, designed to
              help clients manage complex stock movements and automate business processes.
